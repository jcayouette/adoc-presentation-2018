* Hello, I think most of you already know who I am.
* However if not, My name is Joseph Cayouette and I represent the lead technical writer for SUSE Manager.
* I would like to thank Karl for his efforts from the SUSE Doc team and give a warm welcome Lana Brindley our new colleague representing the SUSE Australian branch.

[modernization.goals]
== Goals

* Enable simple contribution (New format Asciidoc)
* Treat AsciiDoc like code
 (branch, fix, pull request, review, merge)
* Automation (Review, Merge, build, and publish via travisci)
* Building a community around SUSE Manager and Uyuni

[NOTE.speaker]

* So Ill get right into it. We have a fair amount of content to cover.
I think most of us would agree that XML is machine friendly, and ultimately as a source quite unfriendly for us to digest or work with as humans.
Asciidoc fulfills the requirement as a human friendly source and provides output to machine friendly XML.
* It would be useful for documentation to be written as code along with the feature development of a product.
Docs are doomed to be behind release if they are not written along side the development of new features.
* Developers should write explanatory documentation at stable intervals while coding to prepare a foundation for technical writers.
* Once reviews are finished on pull requests from contributors, an automated process using travisci picks up the new repo changes and updates online documentation in near realtime.
* It is my hope that the simplified workflow gained by migrating to asciidoc, working with docs as code, and automating publishing of documentation will aid us in establishing a community around SUSE Manager and uyuni.
I have great expectations for Lana, especially regarding her experience around establishing and working with open source community and its culture.

== XML vs. Asciidoc Part I

----
Example: Docbook/XML (fraction)
<table xml:id="tab.wbem.setting.daemon.1" frame="topbot" rowsep="0">
 <title>Commands for Managing sfcbd</title>
 <tgroup cols="2">
 <colspec colnum="1" colname="1"/>
 <colspec colnum="2" colname="2"/>
 <thead>
 <row rowsep="1">
 <entry colname="1">
 <para>
 Task
 </para>
 </entry>
 <entry colname="2">
 <para>
 Linux Command
 </para>
 </entry>
 </row>
 </thead>
 ...

The following example clearly demonstrates why xml should not be used for contribution.
The amount of boilerplate is ridiculous for simple contribution and requires complex tooling to be setup before work can even begin.
For example OxygenXML, vi and emacs all require highly specific configurations via DTDs, and xml catalogs.

[build.process.part.one]
== Build Process Part I

* Docs are written and contributed by community in Asciidoc format
* The Asciidoctor Ruby gem provides the conversion to Docbook 5 XML
* The SUSE Docbook Authoring and Publishing Suite(DAPS) enables export of various formats (PDF, EPUB, HTML Single and chunked)



[build.process.part.two]
== Build Process Part II

* We use a Makefile to bind these tools together and produce our output formats

The current location of our SUSE Manager documentation repository is on github under the SUSE organization.
As you can see github can render adoc sources for viewing.
We also have created a wiki for documention.
The goal of this wiki is to provide guides for working with asciidoc, contributing and styling rules

== The Asciidoc Browser Plugin

* https://github.com/SUSE/doc-susemanager/wiki/Asciidoc-getting-started#asciidoctorjs-browser-extension[Asciidoctorjs Browser Extension (Chrome, Firefox, Opera)]

There is an excellent browser extension that the team behind asciidoctor created for rendering and updating your writing in realtime within the browser.
To use the plugin and see rendered html, open any adoc file you are editing in the browser.
Anytime you save your file, the plugin will pick up the changes on the local file system and update.
